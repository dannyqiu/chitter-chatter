# chitter-chatter

A Systems project by Stanley Lok, Danny Qiu, and Ivy Wong

### Requirements

- [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org)
    - Install on Ubuntu using `sudo apt-get install build-essential gnome-devel`

### Bugs

- Since this is a simple chat server/client model, we don't have cross-compability support. Therefore, optimal performance is reached when all machines are the same. This will be improved in a future version when we implement packing for chat packets
